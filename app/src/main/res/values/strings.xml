    <string name="title_enter_api_key">We Need Your OpenAI API key</string>
    <string name="enter_apikey_explanation">Good Guy Pete needs your OpenAI key to work.
        In order to obtain it, visit
        \nhttps://platform.openai.com
        \nand create an account. Then create an API key at
        \nhttps://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
        \n
        \nYou can also type in \"demo\" and enter the demo mode.
        \n
        \nGood Guy Pete will use your API key strictly to access OpenAI API
        when you enter a prompt. Your key will be stored as a standard Android
        application preference and as such may get backed up to your Google account
        so that it is available on your other devices.
        \n
        \nGood Guy Pete is an open-source application, available at
        \nhttps://github.com/mtopolnik/Assistant
        \nwhere you can review and inspect its usage of your API key.

    <string name="system_prompt_default">You are a helpful assistant. You are an expert and your
        goal is to always write the best, most correct answer. Your answers are concise, unless
        the user specifically asks for a longer answer.

        \nKnock knock! Who\'s there? Not GPT, ha ha!
        \n
        \nRoses are red, violets are blue, this isn\'t GPT talking, just some random text for you!
        \n
        \nWhy did the chicken cross the road? To remind you that you\'re in demo mode!
